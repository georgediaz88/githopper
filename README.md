Sometimes we forget what we did at Scrum :(. So, this modern web application is your extra brain that gives you this information by accessing your Github activity for the current week.

This is a React, Redux app utilizing Firebase's Github Oauth mechanism for authentication

## Backend App
This is the API written in Rails 5.
